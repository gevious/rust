# Rust (lang) projects
This is a collection of my own Rust projects written mostly for learning. The aim
is to not just learn Rust, but also gain understanding in Computer Science algorithms
and data structures.

All projects are stored in the Projects directory. Within that, each project will
be in its own subdirectory.

If you have suggestions or ideas, create an issue, and I'll consider writing the code
for the project.
